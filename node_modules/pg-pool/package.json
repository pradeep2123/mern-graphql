To use pg-pool on heroku, for example, you need to parse the URL into a config object. Here is an example of how to parse a Database URL.\n\n```js\nconst Pool = require('pg-pool');\nconst url = require('url')\n\nconst params = url.parse(process.env.DATABASE_URL);\nconst auth = params.auth.split(':');\n\nconst config = {\n  user: auth[0],\n  password: auth[1],\n  host: params.hostname,\n  port: params.port,\n  database: params.pathname.split('/')[1],\n  ssl: true\n};\n\nconst pool = new Pool(config);\n\n/*\n  Transforms, 'progres://DBuser:secret@DBHost:#####/myDB', into\n  config = {\n    user: 'DBuser',\n    password: 'secret',\n    host: 'DBHost',\n    port: '#####',\n    database: 'myDB',\n    ssl: true\n  }\n*/\n``` \n\n### acquire clients with a promise\n\npg-pool supports a fully promise-based api for acquiring clients\n\n```js\nvar pool = new Pool()\npool.connect().then(client => {\n  client.query('select $1::text as name', ['pg-pool']).then(res => {\n    client.release()\n    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)\n  })\n  .catch(e => {\n    client.release()\n    console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### plays nice with async/await\n\nthis ends up looking much nicer if you're using [co](https://github.com/tj/co) or async/await:\n\n```js\n// with async/await\n(async () => {\n  var pool = new Pool()\n  var client = await pool.connect()\n  try {\n    var result = await client.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])\n    console.log('hello from', result.rows[0])\n  } finally {\n    client.release()\n  }\n})().catch(e => console.error(e.message, e.stack))\n\n// with co\nco(function * () {\n  var client = yield pool.connect()\n  try {\n    var result = yield client.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])\n    console.log('hello from', result.rows[0])\n  } finally {\n    client.release()\n  }\n}).catch(e => console.error(e.message, e.stack))\n```\n\n### your new favorite helper method\n\nbecause its so common to just run a query and return the client to the pool afterward pg-pool has this built-in:\n\n```js\nvar pool = new Pool()\nvar time = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()')\nvar name = await pool.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])\nconsole.log(name.rows[0].name, 'says hello at', time.rows[0].name)\n```\n\nyou can also use a callback here if you'd like:\n\n```js\nvar pool = new Pool()\npool.query('SELECT $1::text as name', ['brianc'], function (err, res) {\n  console.log(res.rows[0].name) // brianc\n})\n```\n\n__pro tip:__ unless you need to run a transaction (which requires a single client for multiple queries) or you\nhave some other edge case like [streaming rows](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-query-stream) or using a [cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-cursor)\nyou should almost always just use `pool.query`.  Its easy, it does the right thing :tm:, and wont ever forget to return\nclients back to the pool after the query is done.\n\n### drop-in backwards compatible\n\npg-pool still and will always support the traditional callback api for acquiring a client.  This is the exact API node-postgres has shipped with for years:\n\n```js\nvar pool = new Pool()\npool.connect((err, client, done) => {\n  if (err) return done(err)\n\n  client.query('SELECT $1::text as name', ['pg-pool'], (err, res) => {\n    done()\n    if (err) {\n      return console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)\n    }\n    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### shut it down\n\nWhen you are finished with the pool if all the clients are idle the pool will close them after `config.idleTimeoutMillis` and your app\nwill shutdown gracefully.  If you don't want to wait for the timeout you can end the pool as follows:\n\n```js\nvar pool = new Pool()\nvar client = await pool.connect()\nconsole.log(await client.query('select now()'))\nclient.release()\nawait pool.end()\n```\n\n### a note on instances\n\nThe pool should be a __long-lived object__ in your application.  Generally you'll want to instantiate one pool when your app starts up and use the same instance of the pool throughout the lifetime of your application.  If you are frequently creating a new pool within your code you likely don't have your pool initialization code in the correct place.  Example:\n\n```js\n// assume this is a file in your program at ./your-app/lib/db.js\n\n// correct usage: create the pool and let it live\n// 'globally' here, controlling access to it through exported methods\nvar pool = new pg.Pool()\n\n// this is the right way to export the query method\nmodule.exports.query = (text, values) => {\n  console.log('query:', text, values)\n  return pool.query(text, values)\n}\n\n// this would be the WRONG way to export the connect method\nmodule.exports.connect = () => {\n  // notice how we would be creating a pool instance here\n  // every time we called 'connect' to get a new client?\n  // that's a bad thing & results in creating an unbounded\n  // number of pools & therefore connections\n  var aPool = new pg.Pool()\n  return aPool.connect()\n}\n```\n\n### events\n\nEvery instance of a `Pool` is an event emitter.  These instances emit the following events:\n\n#### error\n\nEmitted whenever an idle client in the pool encounters an error.  This is common when your PostgreSQL server shuts down, reboots, or a network partition otherwise causes it to become unavailable while your pool has connected clients.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst Pool = require('pg-pool')\nconst pool = new Pool()\n\n// attach an error handler to the pool for when a connected, idle client\n// receives an error by being disconnected, etc\npool.on('error', function(error, client) {\n  // handle this in the same way you would treat process.on('uncaughtException')\n  // it is supplied the error as well as the idle client which received the error\n})\n```\n\n#### connect\n\nFired whenever the pool creates a __new__ `pg.Client` instance and successfully connects it to the backend.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst Pool = require('pg-pool')\nconst pool = new Pool()\n\nvar count = 0\n\npool.on('connect', client => {\n  client.count = count++\n})\n\npool\n  .connect()\n  .then(client => {\n    return client\n      .query('SELECT $1::int AS \"clientCount\"', [client.count])\n      .then(res => console.log(res.rows[0].clientCount)) // outputs 0\n      .then(() => client)\n  })\n  .then(client => client.release())\n\n```\n\n#### acquire\n\nFired whenever the a client is acquired from the pool\n\nExample:\n\nThis allows you to count the number of clients which have ever been acquired from the pool.\n\n```js\nvar Pool = require('pg-pool')\nvar pool = new Pool()\n\nvar acquireCount = 0\npool.on('acquire', function (client) {\n  acquireCount++\n})\n\nvar connectCount = 0\npool.on('connect', function () {\n  connectCount++\n})\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 200; i++) {\n  pool.query('SELECT NOW()')\n}\n\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log('connect count:', connectCount) // output: connect count: 10\n  console.log('acquire count:', acquireCount) // output: acquire count: 200\n}, 100)\n\n```\n\n### environment variables\n\npg-pool & node-postgres support some of the same environment variables as `psql` supports.  The most common are:\n\n```\nPGDATABASE=my_db\nPGUSER=username\nPGPASSWORD=\"my awesome password\"\nPGPORT=5432\nPGSSLMODE=require\n```\n\nUsually I will export these into my local environment via a `.env` file with environment settings or export them in `~/.bash_profile` or something similar.  This way I get configurability which works with both the postgres suite of tools (`psql`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) and node, I can vary the environment variables locally and in production, and it supports the concept of a [12-factor app](http://12factor.net/) out of the box.\n\n## bring your own promise\n\nIn versions of node `<=0.12.x` there is no native promise implementation available globally.  You can polyfill the promise globally like this:\n\n```js\n// first run `npm install promise-polyfill --save\nif (typeof Promise == 'undefined') {\n  global.Promise = require('promise-polyfill')\n}\n```\n\nYou can use any other promise implementation you'd like.  The pool also allows you to configure the promise implementation on a per-pool level:\n\n```js\nvar bluebirdPool = new Pool({\n  Promise: require('bluebird')\n})\n```\n\n__please note:__ in node `<=0.12.x` the pool will throw if you do not provide a promise constructor in one of the two ways mentioned above.  In node `>=4.0.0` the pool will use the native promise implementation by default; however, the two methods above still allow you to \"bring your own.\"\n\n## tests\n\nTo run tests clone the repo, `npm i` in the working dir, and then run `npm test`\n\n## contributions\n\nI love contributions.  Please make sure they have tests, and submit a PR.  If you're not sure if the issue is worth it or will be accepted it never hurts to open an issue to begin the conversation.  If you're interested in keeping up with node-postgres releated stuff, you can follow me on twitter at [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) - I generally announce any noteworthy updates there.\n\n## license\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2016 Brian M.
